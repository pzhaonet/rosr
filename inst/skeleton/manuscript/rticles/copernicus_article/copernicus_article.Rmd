  \section{Figures and tables in appendices}
  Regarding figures and tables in appendices, the following two options are possible depending on your general handling of figures and tables in the manuscript environment:
  \subsection{Option 1}
  If you sorted all figures and tables into the sections of the text, please also sort the appendix figures and appendix tables into the respective appendix sections.
  They will be correctly named automatically.
  \subsection{Option 2}
  If you put all figures after the reference list, please insert appendix tables and figures after the normal tables and figures.
  
  To rename them correctly to A1, A2, etc., please add the following commands in front of them:
  `\appendixfigures` needs to be added in front of appendix figures
  `\appendixtables` needs to be added in front of appendix tables
  
  Please add `\clearpage` between each table and/or figure. Further guidelines on figures and tables can be found below.

\introduction

This template comes from the R 'rticles' package and modified by Peng Zhao. It intends to show how to cross refer other files in a 'rosr' project, rather than to show how to use the 'rticles' template.


# Methods

## Set up

Firstly, we switch off the codes and message display in a manuscript, and set the working directory to the rosr project.

```R
oldwd <- getwd()
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE, warning = FALSE, message = FALSE) 
knitr::opts_knit$set(root.dir = dirname(dirname(oldwd)))
```

## Load data

Now we can use the relative path. Let's sync the bib file and run an R script.

```{r load, results='hide'}
file.copy('bib/rosr.bib', oldwd)
source('R/rosr.R')
```

## Cite

Here we cite something like this:

Many R packages have been developed recently [@R-pinyin; @R-beginr; @R-bookdownplus; @R-mindr; @R-rmd; @R-steemr].

# Results and Discussions

## Numbers

As we just ran the `source()` command, we can use the results from the `R/rosr.R`. For example, the mean temperature is `r temperature` degree.

## Tables

We could insert a table as in Table \@ref(tab:tab-lab).

```{r tab-lab}
knitr::kable(head(aq), booktabs = TRUE, caption = 'Air quality data.')
```

## Figures

Plot the data in a diagram as shown in Fig. \@ref(fig:fig-lab).

```{r fig-lab, fig.cap='Air quality data.'}
plot(aq)
```

We could insert an image like Fig \@ref(fig:img-lab).

```{r img-lab, fig.cap='Insert an image.'}
fig('rosr_R.png')
```

## Equations

Use the `rosr::eq()` function to insert an equation. See Eq. \@ref(eq:sd)

```{r, results='asis'}
eqs <- 'equation/rosr-eq.Rmd'
eq(eqs, label = 'sd')
```

\conclusions

The conclusion goes here.
You can modify the section name with  `\conclusions[modified heading if necessary]`.
